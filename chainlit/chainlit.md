## What You Can Do 🎯

### **Multi-Omics Analysis**
- **Transcriptomics**: Analyze RNA-seq data, differential expression, pathway enrichment, and more (fully supported)
- **Proteomics**: Process protein expression data, identify biomarkers, and perform network analysis (under development)
- **Metabolomics**: Future feature — Support for metabolite profiling and pathway analysis is planned.
- **Microbiome**: Future feature — Microbiome data analysis capabilities are in the works.

### **Key Features**
- **Interactive Data Analysis**: Upload your omics data files and get AI-assisted analysis
- **Automated Workflow Extraction**: Extract analysis workflows from research papers
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Generate publication-ready plots including heatmaps, volcano plots, PCA, UMAP, and more
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and network analysis
- **Database Integration**: Access various biological databases for gene annotation, pathway information, and protein interactions

## About OmicsHorizon™ ℹ️

OmicsHorizon™ is an integrated platform designed to streamline your omics research workflow. Whether you're working with transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, or microbiome data, OmicsHorizon™ provides the tools and AI assistance you need to transform raw data into meaningful biological insights.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Upload Your Data**: Share your omics data files (CSV, TSV, Excel, or other supported formats)
2. **Ask Questions**: Describe what analysis you'd like to perform
3. **Get Results**: Receive comprehensive analysis results with visualizations and interpretations

## Configuration ⚙️

### Cost Tracking
- **Environment Variable**: `COST_TRACKING_ENABLED`
- **Default**: `false`
- **Description**: Tracks LLM API call costs and generates cost reports for each session
- **Enable**: Set `COST_TRACKING_ENABLED=true` in `chainlit/run.sh` or environment

### Workflow Saving
- **Environment Variable**: `BIOMNI_WORKFLOW_SAVING_ENABLED`
- **Default**: `false`
- **Description**: Automatically saves executed analysis workflows as Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) files after agent execution
- **Enable**: Set `BIOMNI_WORKFLOW_SAVING_ENABLED=true` in `chainlit/run.sh` or environment
- **Output Location**: `{work_dir}/workflows/workflows/workflow_*.ipynb`
- **Note**: Saved notebooks can be executed both in Jupyter and via command-line with `jupyter nbconvert --execute`

## Supported Data Types 📊

- Gene expression data (RNA-seq, microarray)
- Protein expression data
- Metabolite data
- Microbiome sequencing data
- Various tabular formats (CSV, TSV, Excel, JSON)

## Example Queries 💡

- "Analyze this transcriptomics data for differential expression between treatment and control groups"
