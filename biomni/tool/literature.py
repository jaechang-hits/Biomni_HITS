    Fetches supplementary information for a scientific paper using its DOI and downloads associated files.

    This function resolves a DOI to the publisher's webpage, searches for supplementary materials
    (such as data files, appendices, or additional documents), and downloads them to a local directory.
    It provides detailed logging of the entire process for research tracking purposes.

    Args:
        doi (str): The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of the paper. Should be in the format
            "10.xxxx/xxxxx" (e.g., "10.1038/nature12373"). The function will attempt to resolve
            this DOI using the CrossRef API.
        output_dir (str, optional): The local directory path where supplementary files will be
            saved. Defaults to "supplementary_info". The directory will be created if it doesn't
            exist. Files are saved with their original names from the download URLs.

    Returns:
        str: A detailed research log as a newline-separated string containing:
            - DOI resolution status and publisher URL
            - List of discovered supplementary material links
            - Download status for each file (success/failure)
            - Summary of total files downloaded
            - Any error messages encountered during the process

        If no supplementary materials are found or if the DOI cannot be resolved,
        the log will contain appropriate error messages.

    Raises:
        requests.RequestException: If network requests fail (handled internally, logged to output)
        OSError: If the output directory cannot be created (handled internally, logged to output)

    Example:

    Parameters
    ----------
    query : str
        The search query string. PubMed supports various search formats:
        - Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms (e.g., "diabetes mellitus"[MeSH])

        - Free text searches combining multiple terms

    max_papers : int, optional
        Maximum number of papers to retrieve from search results. Default is 10.

    max_retries : int, optional
        Maximum number of retry attempts if the initial query returns no results. Default is 3.
        The retry mechanism progressively simplifies the query by removing words from the end,
        making it more likely to find relevant papers for overly specific queries.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Formatted search results containing for each paper:

    """
    Perform advanced web search using Claude AI with integrated web search capabilities.

    This function leverages Claude's web search tool to conduct intelligent, multi-step
    web searches that go beyond simple keyword matching. Claude can understand context,
    follow up on initial results, and synthesize information from multiple sources to
    provide comprehensive answers with proper citations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query : str
        The search query or question for Claude to investigate. Should be:
        - Specific and well-formulated (e.g., "What are the latest developments in mRNA vaccine technology?")
        - Complex questions that benefit from AI analysis (e.g., "Compare different CRISPR delivery methods for in vivo applications")
        - Research questions requiring synthesis of multiple sources
        - Topics needing current, up-to-date information
        - Scientific protocols or methodology questions

        Avoid overly broad queries; be specific about what information you're seeking.

    max_searches : int, optional
        Maximum number of web searches Claude can perform for this query. Default is 1.
        Higher values allow for more comprehensive research but increase cost and time:
        - 1-2: Quick, focused searches for straightforward questions
        - 3-5: Moderate research requiring multiple sources
        - 5+: Comprehensive research on complex topics

    max_retries : int, optional
        Maximum number of retry attempts if the initial request fails. Default is 3.
        Uses exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays) between retries to handle:
        - Temporary network issues
        - API rate limiting
        - Transient service errors

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A comprehensive formatted response containing:
        - Claude's synthesized analysis of the search results
        - Key findings and insights
        - Inline citations with source titles and URLs in the format:
          "(Citation: Source Title - URL)"
        - Structured information organized by topic or relevance

        If an error occurs after all retry attempts, returns an error message
        starting with "Error performing web search after X attempts:"

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        - If the model is not a Claude model (must contain "claude" in the name)
        - If no API key is provided or found in environment variables

    Exception
        Various exceptions may occur during web search:
        - Network connectivity issues
        - Anthropic API rate limiting
        - Invalid API key or authentication errors
        - Timeout errors
        - Service unavailability

    Configuration Requirements
    -------------------------
    This function requires either:
    1. A configured biomni.config.default_config with:
       - llm: Claude model name (e.g., "claude-4-sonnet-latest")
       - api_key: Valid Anthropic API key
    2. Or environment variable ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set to a valid API key

    Examples
    --------
    >>> response = advanced_web_search_claude("latest CRISPR base editing techniques 2024")
    >>> print(response)
    Based on recent research, several advanced CRISPR base editing techniques have emerged in 2024...

    Prime editing has been enhanced with improved efficiency through... (Citation: Nature Biotechnology - https://www.nature.com/articles/...)

    New cytosine base editors with reduced off-target effects... (Citation: Science - https://www.science.org/doi/...)

    >>> response = advanced_web_search_claude(
    ...     "How do different COVID-19 vaccine platforms compare in terms of efficacy and safety?",
    ...     max_searches=3
    ... )
    >>> print(response)
    COVID-19 vaccines can be categorized into several platforms, each with distinct characteristics:

    mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) show... (Citation: NEJM - https://www.nejm.org/doi/...)
    Viral vector vaccines (Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca)... (Citation: The Lancet - https://www.thelancet.com/journals/...)

    >>> response = advanced_web_search_claude("nonexistent topic xyz123 research")
    >>> print(response)
    I searched for information about "nonexistent topic xyz123 research" but was unable to find any relevant...

    Notes
    -----
    - Uses Anthropic's Claude model with the web_search_20250305 tool
    - Includes random delays (1-10 seconds) before requests to avoid overwhelming the API
    - Citations are automatically extracted and formatted inline with the response
    - The function is designed for research and information gathering, not real-time data
    - Results quality depends on Claude's ability to understand the query and find relevant sources
    - More complex queries generally benefit from higher max_searches values
    - Consider the cost implications of higher max_searches values

    Performance Tips
    ----------------
    - Craft specific, well-structured queries for best results
    - Use higher max_searches (3-5) for complex, multi-faceted questions
    - Keep max_searches low (1-2) for straightforward factual queries
    - Include relevant keywords and context in your query
    - Specify time frames if current information is needed (e.g., "2024 developments in...")

            - Corrupted PDF files
            - Password-protected PDFs
            - Unsupported PDF versions
            - Memory issues with very large PDFs

    PDF Detection and Validation:
        1. **Direct PDF URLs**: If URL ends with .pdf, downloads directly
        2. **Indirect URLs**: Searches HTML content for PDF links using regex
        3. **Content validation**: Checks both Content-Type header and PDF magic bytes (%PDF)
        4. **Relative URL handling**: Converts relative PDF paths to absolute URLs

    Text Extraction Process:
        1. Downloads PDF content into memory (BytesIO buffer)
        2. Validates PDF format using magic bytes and content type
        3. Uses PyPDF2.PdfReader to parse PDF structure
        4. Extracts text from each page sequentially
        5. Normalizes whitespace and formatting
        6. Combines all pages with double newline separators

    Examples:
        >>> content = extract_pdf_content("https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf")
        >>> print(content[:200])

        The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
        convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and decoder...

        CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in human cells

        We describe a set of tools for genome editing based on the Cas9 nuclease...

        >>> content = extract_pdf_content("https://example.com/not-a-pdf")
        >>> print(content)
        No PDF file found at https://example.com/not-a-pdf. Please provide a direct link to a PDF file.

        >>> content = extract_pdf_content("https://example.com/scanned-document.pdf")
        >>> print(content)
        The PDF file did not contain any extractable text. It may be an image-based PDF requiring OCR.

    Notes:
        - Uses 30-second timeout for downloads to handle large PDF files
        - Automatically handles relative URLs by constructing absolute paths
        - Searches for PDF links using case-insensitive regex pattern
        - Memory-efficient processing using BytesIO for large files
        - Whitespace normalization improves readability of extracted text
        - Works best with text-based PDFs; scanned documents may not extract properly

    Limitations:
        - Cannot extract text from image-based or scanned PDFs (requires OCR)
        - Password-protected PDFs will fail extraction
        - Very large PDFs may cause memory issues
        - Complex formatting (tables, columns) may not preserve structure
        - Mathematical equations and special symbols may not extract correctly
        - Some PDF encryption or protection schemes may prevent text extraction

    Performance Considerations:
        - Large PDFs (>100MB) may take significant time to download and process
        - Network speed affects download time for remote PDFs
        - Complex PDFs with many pages may have slower text extraction
        - Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed PDFs
